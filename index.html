Synchronous:
- In synchronous operations tasks are performed one at a time and only when one 
is completed, the following is unblocked. In other words, you need to wait for a
task to finish to move to the next one.

Asynchronous:
- In asynchronous operations, you can move to another task 
before the previous one finishes.

synchronous vs asynchronous encryptionWhatever By Outrageous Orangutan on May 5 2021 ThankComment
Encryption can be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous cryptography is mostly used for data at rest, and also for digital signature. Asynchronous cryptography is usually used for data in transit and in cases where encryption and decryption keys need to be shared or exchanged.
